how?
- to read 161 page pdf for specific column without any miss reading 
test: testing for 5 dummy data (pass)
test: convert 161 page pdf to txt for column id_pembekal and nama_pembekal (pass) - medium use chatgpt(failed for first QnA), claude ai(failed without QnA because limit), grok(pass for first QnA)

- to make nama_pembekal (senarai pembekal) search for first word and then second word to find same a (senarai aset spa)
test:(cancel)

- a = nama_pembekal (senarai pembekal)
- b = id_pembekal (senarai pembekal)

- c = pembekal (senarai aset spa)
- d = kod_pembekal (senarai aset spa)

requirements
- check 'a' must equal to 'c' (pass)
- if check is same then take the 'a' value and search for all value that have 'a' in 'c' (pass) 
- if value exist take 'b' value that have 'a' == 'c' (pass)
- write all 'b' value in 'd' based on all value that exist after search (pass)

issue
- some pembekal have two different id_pembekal?
- human error? - test upload on git to track changes

based on this pseudo write for me a python code to make this as simple autoamtion system for proof of concept by using only 5 dummy data. below i provide raw dummy data for senarai pembekal and senarai aset spa (pass by claude ai)

- senarai pembekal (pass)
